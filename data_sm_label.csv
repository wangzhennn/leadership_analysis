Luu T.T.,36640695200;,A tale of two countries: How do employees with disabilities respond to disability inclusive HR practices in tourism and hospitality industry?,style_transformational,leadership_style,"Though inclusive initiatives generally and disability inclusive practices particularly can contribute to the sustainable development goals in the tourism industry, the tourism research has been scarce about the work and life experiences of employees with disabilities and the impact of disability inclusive initiatives on such experiences. This study aims to unravel how disability inclusive HR practices influence work-family interface outcomes among employees with disabilities. South Korean and Vietnamese tourism and hospitality industries served as the contexts for comparative analysis of our research model. Valid responses were collected from 394 employees with disabilities from Vietnam-based companies and from 368 employees with disabilities from Korea-based companies. The results unveiled that in both samples, disability inclusive leadership mediated the nexuses between disability inclusive HR practices and work-family conflict as well as work-family enrichment among employees with disabilities. Leaders’ work-family conflict attenuated the negative relationship between disability inclusive leadership and employee work-family conflict in both research contexts. Nonetheless, while the interactional effect of disability inclusive leadership and leaders’ work-family enrichment was imposed on work-family enrichment among Vietnamese employees with disabilities, this moderation mechanism was not supported in the Korean sample. Implications for disability management literature and practice are discussed. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2021,Journal of Sustainable Tourism,Disability inclusive human resource practices; disability inclusive leadership; work-family conflict; work-family enrichment,Disability inclusive human resource practices; disability inclusive leadership; work-family conflict; work-family enrichment

The results indicated that a principal’s transformational leadership strongly affected a supportive learning culture, which is an organisational-level knowledge asset, which in turn led to knowledge creation practices in schools. From a cross-cultural perspective, a principal’s leadership directly affected knowledge creation practices of teachers in Korean schools, whereas a supportive learning culture was found to be more influential on teachers’ attitudes and behaviours related to knowledge creation in US schools. Our study contributes to a better understanding of conditions for knowledge creation practices from a cross-cultural perspective and provides several important implications for the knowledge management literature. © Operational Research Society 2019.",2021,Knowledge Management Research and Practice,knowledge creation practices; multigroup structural equation modelling; supportive learning culture; Transformational leadership; work engagement,knowledge creation practices; multigroup structural equation modelling; supportive learning culture; Transformational leadership; work engagement
Ajgaonkar M.,57215497540;,Student leadership programme: igniting the young minds,organizational,organizational,"Learning outcomes: This case will help students to understand the following: Develop a basic understanding of competency building processes. Learn about the mentoring process and its application in leadership development. Develop awareness about the methodology for assessment of the effectiveness of training. Case overview/synopsis: Dr A. R. K. Pillai founded the Indian Leprosy Foundation in 1970 in response to the national call by late Mrs Indira Gandhi, prime minister of India, to the public-spirited people to take up leprosy eradication. It collaborated with international agencies to reduce leprosy drastically in India from four million, in 1982 to around a hundred thousand cases in 2006. In 2006, the Indian Leprosy Foundation was renamed as Indian Development Foundation (IDF) as the trustees decided to expand the work of IDF in the areas of health, children’s education and women’s empowerment. Dr Narayan Iyer, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of IDF initiated a leadership development intervention called the Students’ leadership programme (SLP) for children in the age group of 12 to 14, from the urban poor households in 2014. It was a structured mentoring programme spanning over three months in collaboration with the schools. It aimed at incubating skills in the areas of leadership, teamwork, personality, behavioural traits and provided career guidance. It had a humble beginning in 2014 with a coverage of 50 students. Initially, IDF welcomed executives from the corporate sector as mentors. As there was a need to rapidly expand the scope of SLP to the other cities of India, IDF tied up with the graduate colleges and invited the students to be the mentors. The other objective behind this move was to create social awareness among the students from more affluent strata of society. IDF was able to dramatically increase the participation of the students through SLP by approximately up to 100,000 by 2020. However, rapid progress threw up multiple challenges. The teachers complained about the non-availability of the students for regular classes to teach the syllabus as the students were busy with SLP. The schools forced IDF to shorten the duration of SLP to two months. Also, many undergraduate mentors were unable to coach the participants due to lack of maturity and found wanting to strike a rapport with them. There was a shortage of corporate executives who volunteered for the mentoring, due to work pressures. Dr Narayan, CEO & National Coordinator and Ms Mallika Ramchandran, the project head of SLP at IDF, were worried about the desired impact of SLP on the participants and its sustainability due to these challenges. So, with the support of Dr Narayan, she initiated a detailed survey to assess the ground-level impact of SLP. The objective was to get clarity about what was working for SLP and what aspects needed to improve, to make the programme more effective. Overall feedback from the survey was very positive. The mothers had seen very positive changes in the participants’ behaviour post-SLP. The teachers had specific concerns about the effectiveness of undergraduate mentors. The need for a refresher course to inculcate ethical behaviour and the inadequacy of the two-month duration of the SLP to reinforce values were highlighted. Respondents also voiced the requirement to build responsible citizenship behaviours among the participants. Mallika was all for preparing a model to further enhance the effectiveness of SLP. Dr Narayan and Mallika embraced the challenge and they were raring to go to develop SLP as a cutting-edge leadership programme and to take it to new heights. Complexity academic level: This case can be used in courses on human resource management in postgraduate and graduate management programmes. It can also be used in the general and development management courses and during executive education programmes to teach methodologies for evaluating the effectiveness of the training interventions, with emphasis on the voluntary sector.

Design/methodology/approach: In this field study, with online surveys, multisource data were collected from 218 United States Air Force officers and their subordinates. Data were analyzed with MEDCURVE SPSS macro tools. Findings: A nonlinear indirect effect of leader honesty/humility on subordinate OCBI through subordinate moral identity centrality was found. This conditional indirect effect occurred through a curvilinear (inverted U-shape) relationship between leader honesty/humility and subordinate moral identity centrality and a positive linear relationship between subordinate moral identity centrality and OCBI. Research limitations/implications: Cross-sectional data were collected. Future research might replicate findings using experimental and longitudinal designs. Practical implications: Recruiting and selecting leaders who possess a moderate level of honesty/humility may serve as the first step in producing prosocial behavior during social interactions with subordinates. Originality/value: This study extends the literature on character and leadership by applying the too-much-of-a-good-thing principle to empirically test the complex nature of the relationship between leader honesty/humility and subordinate OCBI as mediated through subordinate moral identity centrality. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2020,Journal of Managerial Psychology,Ethics; Leadership; Positive psychology; Social identity,Ethics; Leadership; Positive psychology; Social identity
"Koburtay T., Haloub R.",57204425336;57204177837;,Does person–organization spirituality fit stimulate ethical and spiritual leaders: an empirical study in Jordan,style_transformational,leadership_style,"Purpose: This paper emphasizes the theoretical relevance that workplace spirituality may add to the person–organization (P-O) fit theory through the examination of a framework that comprises how workplace and self-spirituality fit enhances the perceived P-O spirituality fit. A related aim is to test how the perceived P-O spirituality fit enhances both employees' ethical and spiritual leadership behavior. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using a quantitative study of 132 employees across various organizations in Jordan. Data were firstly checked by the use of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and reliability tests. Hypotheses have been tested by the use of hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Findings: In line with the hypotheses, the study's results exhibited that workplace and self-spirituality fit positively enhances the perceived P-O spirituality fit. The results also show that the perceived P-O spirituality fit enhances both employees' ethical and spiritual leadership behaviors. Practical implications: The present study warrants several practices for human resource management (HRM), policy and development. It suggests that HRM practices should encourage a more “spiritual– and ethical-friendly” environment by ensuring that staffing and other HRM responsibilities are clearly committed to ethics and supportive of spirituality. Specifically, within performance appraisal policies, HR managers may include specific policies and ethical action targets to promote more ethical behaviors. There may be regular monitoring to track the trajectory of the HRM practices in this regard. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper extends beyond the vast literature on P-O fit with the generation of a new concept (i.e. P-O spirituality fit) to the literature in a Muslim-majority country. This offers reinvigorated awareness of the topic under study and suggests specific future research directions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2022,Personnel Review,Ethics; Leadership; Person–organization fit; Spirituality,Ethics; Leadership; Person–organization fit; Spirituality
Miller M.T.,57189893953;,Do learning organizations learn? Higher education institutions and pandemic response strategies,organizational,organizational,"Purpose: This study was designed to address the problem of how higher education institutions, as organizations designed to promote learning, responded to the COVID pandemic and the suspension of in-person instruction. The purpose of this paper was specifically to explore how institutions go about learning from the pandemic to better prepare themselves for the future that they will face. Design/methodology/approach: A researcher-developed survey instrument was distributed electronically to 300 faculty leaders at randomly selected universities in the USA. With three follow-up e-mail requests, the survey had a 31% usable response rate. Findings: Survey results indicated that institutional leadership did not make strong use of shared governance in responding to the COVID pandemic in creating operational response strategies. Further, institutions did not alter their policies or make structural changes to be more adept in facing the challenges of a global pandemic and its impact on the financial well-being of the institutions. Although institutions did make changes to their attitudes about students, these were not developmental changes but rather behavioral modification expectations. Originality/value: This study drew upon data collected after the first three months of the global COVID pandemic, providing an important first-look at organizational behavior in response to a largely unplanned global event. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2020,Learning Organization,Change management; Education; Higher education; Innovation; Knowledge organizations,Change management; Education; Higher education; Innovation; Knowledge organizations

The role of green human resource management and environmental felt-responsibility,style_ethical,leadership_style,"Drawing on social information processing theory, the current study investigates the relationship between top management team (TMT) responsible leadership and employee organizational citizenship behavior for the environment (OCBE) from a vertical perspective, and whether green human resource management (GHRM) and employee environmental felt-responsibility can play a sequential mediating role between them. Totally, 102 middle-level managers and 527 employees in 102 Chinese teams voluntarily participated in our study. Drawing on above data, our study verifies that TMT responsible leadership was positively associated with both GHRM and employee environmental felt-responsibility. In addition, GHRM mediated the positive effects of TMT responsible leadership and employee environmental felt-responsibility. Also, GHRM can further promote employee OCBE through employee environmental felt-responsibility. Overall, the positive relationship between TMT responsible leadership and employee OCBE was sequentially mediated by GHRM and employee environmental felt-responsibility. Therefore, the current study shows the way to achieve corporate environmental sustainability strategy. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2022,Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management,environmental felt-responsibility; GHRM; OCBE; TMT responsible leadership,environmental felt-responsibility; GHRM; OCBE; TMT responsible leadership

Design/methodology/approach: This study was conducted in Malang Regency Government by using a sample of 120 respondents and Generalized Structured Component Analysis (GeSCA). Findings: From the study, it is found that ethical leadership could influence the formation of ethical climate in an organization which in turn will negatively affect the deviant behavior in the workplace. The results also indicate that the effect of ethical leadership is either direct or indirect toward the deviant behavior in the workplace. The indirect impact of this ethical leadership includes the sharpened perception of ethical climate which eventually will reduce the deviant behavior in the workplace.

Positive psychology as a field was founded on the belief that people want to lead meaningful and fulfilling lives, to cultivate what is best within them, and enhance their experiences of love, work and play. However, the potential need to incorporate the principles of positive psychology to enhance the lives of employees at workplace has been identified very lately. This review article starts with the journey from positive psychology to positive organizational behaviour (POB) followed by the elaborated conceptual development of psychological capital (PsyCap) and its uniqueness in relation to other positive constructs. Next section of the article presents evidence of major theoretical contributions in developing the field of POB and PsyCap along with distinction between states versus trait paradigm in Psychology. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of recently introduced concept of PsyCap and reveal its antecedents and consequences. We have synthesized and integrated recent empirical research examining the nature of the construct of PsyCap and develop a conceptual framework regarding its individual and organizational antecedents and consequences for further understanding of the relevant issues in the area of PsyCap and POB. The organizational level antecedents of PsyCap included in this article are work engagement, organizational justice, workplace social support and authentic leadership. Likewise, individual level antecedents of PsyCap covered in this article are sense of humour and positive emotions. The major potential outcomes of PsyCap in the present article included both desirable (mental health, organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB), creative performance and ethical performance) and undesirable (incivility) work-related organizational outcomes. Several preliminary propositions have been offered to guide future research and the role of PsyCap within a broad theoretical and empirical context is discussed. Finally, we have discussed the gaps in the relevant literature, major issues for future research on PsyCap along with implications and interventions about how management can enhance each within their employees for performance management, leadership development and HR development. © 2017 XLRI Jamshedpur, School of Business Management & Human Resources.",2017,Management and Labour Studies,antecedents and outcomes of PsyCap; positive organizational behaviour; Positive psychology; psychological capital; state vs. trait paradigm,antecedents and outcomes of PsyCap; positive organizational behaviour; Positive psychology; psychological capital; state vs. trait paradigm

In a company, asset misappropriation has become a major concern to the management of the company because asset misappropriation may seemingly be an insignificant behaviour that will not give so much impact to a company but if it is not treated, it will become worse and it will be difficult to solve. This study analyses the factors that affect asset misappropriation occurrence in a company. Specifically, this study examines the effect of leadership style, organisational culture and internal control on asset misappropriation in an organisation. Using questionnaire survey on 137 employeesin a company, thisstudy shows that all three factors; leadership style, organisational culture and internal control have significant influence on asset misappropriation occurrences in the company, although the effect is negative. The findingsin thisstudy provide insights on fraud to the management of the company. Consequently, this study can assist the management of the company to execute an effective internal control mechanism as well as establish policies pertaining to fraudactivities to ensure that the recent case fraud involving the company will be the last one to occur.

Findings: While the managers are not are expected to be excellent in all aspects, being consistently in the average bracket has far reaching consequences. Companies who have a sizeable number of employees in this category struggle when it comes to pursuing organizational vision and goals. Most performance management systems revolve around the top performers and the non-performers, rewarding the former and penalizing the latter.

Sharma P.N.,52164370700;,Moving beyond the employee: The role of the organizational context in leader workplace aggression,organizational,organizational,"Management and psychology scholars are increasingly seeking to examine how organizational characteristics that contextualize leadership shape the occurrence, impact, and prevention of leader workplace aggression. However, a comprehensive review of this literature has not yet been conducted, so a systematic understanding is lacking regarding questions including: (1) when, why and how is such aggression more likely to occur; (2) how do contextual factors enable or constrain effects of these leader behaviors on employees; and (3) how can organizations proactively manage their internal dynamics to prevent or reduce such incidences? Drawing on Porter and McLaughlin's (2006) components of organizational context, I review existing leader aggression research that intersects with seven categories: (1) culture/climate; (2) goals/purposes; (3) people/composition; (4) processes; (5) state/condition; (6) structure; and (7) time. I then offer theoretical propositions for future work, which are grounded in the roles and responsibilities inherent to the nature of leadership and coupled with the changing nature of organizational life.

The goal of this paper is to heighten managerial awareness of ethical issues, interrelated ethical lapses, and appropriate responsive actions within professional engineering communities. As such, the authors reviewed recent well-known professional and organizational ethical cases including impact of leadership role and existing standards, and critically analyzed interrelated literature. The paper’s case studies exemplify that because ethical issues are complex, intricate, and nuanced; bylaws are insufficient for establishing the inclusive culture for handling potential ethical situations. In fact, through what is known as the codification of ethics, it is possible that someone’s conduct can totally fulfill all professional responsibilities but still be unethical. As such, ethical leadership is needed to provide the means for establishing appropriate norms so as to set the proper structures for addressing the diverse ethical matters. Perceptions about the responses of leaders to potential ethical lapses are a critical factor in formulating, changing, and maintaining ethical values at the individual and organizational levels. A leader’s passive attitude toward ethical issues can be the signal for the ignored lapses to become the norm at not only the organizational level but also the society. Guided by the new Code of Ethics by the American Society of Civil Engineers, this paper aims to trigger the proper ethical behavior and expectations for the welfare of the engineering profession both in the present and future. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",2022,Science and Engineering Ethics,Bylaws; Bystanders; Codifications; Ethical codes; Ethical culture; Ethical norms; Ethics; Leadership; Principles; Standards; Values,Bylaws; Bystanders; Codifications; Ethical codes; Ethical culture; Ethical norms; Ethics; Leadership; Principles; Standards; Values

The effects of other components, such as the perception of organizational justice and psychological security, on this relationship were tested as mediators. Moreover, some demographic elements were considered as controlling factors. The nonprobability convenience sampling method used to collect the data, which were analyzed statistically by applying CFA and structural equation modeling (Path Diagram followed by the maximum likelihood estimation method). It was determined compulsory citizenship behavior increases the academics’ turnover intention in Iranian universities while mediation elements, such as organizational justice and psychological security, reduce this negative consequence. The result shows that reducing the negative influence of CCB in the organization causes less percentage of turnover intention. Rising the employees’ perception of organizational justice and their psychological security, is helpful for the administration to achieve this goal. Findings notify managers that (1) fairness in all work-related outcomes and (2) making the working environment psychologically secure decreases the academics’ intention to leave although they feel the pressure of doing extra-role duties. The most interesting finding is that psychological security held a substantially stronger effect on reducing the negative consequences of CCB than organizational justice. For organizations and managers, the emphasis should be on preparing work environments supportive of high organizational justice and employees’ psychological security to maintain turnover intention at its lowest levels. Regarding the compatibility of the study with the Journal focus, we can mention that results will allow HR practitioners a better understanding of essential factors they have to focus in their leadership style and management efforts to reduce the financial and spiritual costs of turnover intention. © 2022, Technical University of Liberec.

Studies on employees' voluntary environmental behavior (VEB) are increasing in number, in that it is believed that behavior can contribute to achieving organizational sustainability strategy. However, despite the studies being published on this emerging field, leadership is a missing link regarding the psychological mechanism through which VEB can be defined and refined. Drawing on the theories of social learning and social exchange, this study seeks to establish the impact of ecocentric leadership (EL) on VEB and the mediating role of psychological green climate (PGC) in this nexus. Data were collected from wide-ranging business organizations in Bangladesh through a self-administered survey questionnaire. The results indicate that EL wields a significant direct influence on VEB.

The necessary changes that would allow for resolving these problems should, first of all, involve a new approach to human resource management and, in particular, the role of leadership in healthcare units. Numerous studies conducted over the years confirm the growing importance of leadership in modern organizations, especially in the healthcare sector. Purpose of the article: The main goal of the project is to identify the relationships between innovative leadership and the organizational efficiency of healthcare units in the context of innovation levels. The article discusses the research hypotheses concerning the existence of a relationship between management innovation and transformational leadership style in healthcare units, the existence of a relationship between transformational leadership style and the efficiency of healthcare units, the existence of a relationship between management innovation and the efficiency of healthcare units. Methods: The survey was conducted in 100 randomly selected healthcare units in Poland. The analysis of interdependencies was performed, among others, with the use of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, the Kendall rank correlation coefficient, the coefficient of colligation, and a chi-squared test, while the measures were chosen based on their adequacy for correlated variables and their distribution. In order to verify the hypotheses formulated in the study, a number of statistical methods were applied, e.g. descriptive statistics and correlation analysis Findings & Value added: The key result of the study identifies the role of transformational leader-ship style in the relationship between the level of innovativeness and efficiency in healthcare units.

Designated IC moderators might be able to stimulate IC members to participate regularly and make high-quality contributions. In response to calls to integrate organizational behavior and IC research, this study addresses the impact of community moderators’ uses of transformational leadership (TFL) language on member participation. By operationalizing the TFL dimensions—charisma, individualized consideration, and intellectual stimulation—with language cues, this article uses an automated text analysis approach to review 64 firm-hosted ICs with 538,805 posts, analyzed with two hierarchical linear models. The findings show that moderators’ charismatic language cues enhance members’ participation quality and quantity. Although individualized consideration and intellectual stimulation increase participation quality, they decrease participation quantity. Organizations thus should assign moderators to lead ICs by using TFL language strategically, in accordance with the focal IC goals, in terms of the quality and quantity of member contributions to their innovation processes. This article contributes to the literature by exploring how leadership language in online communities can facilitate the development of innovative ideas. In addition, this study offers a more nuanced view on the effects of TFL by revealing both positive and negative outcomes in firm-hosted online ICs and it introduces a new, objective measure of TFL built on linguistic markers. This article also includes specific guidelines for how moderators can achieve effective leadership through their language use, as well as managerial implications for the effective selection, training, and support of IC moderators. © 2021 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) technique was used to develop a hierarchical structural model for enablers. Also, the interpretive ranking process (IRP) was used to analyse and rank enablers with reference to performance variables. For the ISM approach, a structural self- integration matrix was developed with the help of experts’ suggestions and opinions. Cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) analysis was used to analyse the relationship amongst enablers. A total of nine experts were chosen for collecting the primary data in which seven experts belong to the industry and two experts were academicians. The dominant relationship amongst the enablers was analysed through IRP modelling. Findings: A total of 11 enablers were identified for the purpose of this study. The model shows that “leadership and commitment by management”, “human resource management”, “customer relation management”, “supplier relation management” and “information technology system” are the most significant enablers for lean implementation in Bulgarian SMEs as these are positioned at the bottom levels in ISM model. MICMAC analysis shows that five enablers fall in the independent factor, two enablers in linkage factor and four enablers in the dependant factor while there is no enabler in the autonomous factor. ISM and IRP models show that “continuous improvement” is an essential enabler for the successful implementation of lean in Bulgarian SMEs. This study also helps to explain the comparative analysis of ISM and IRP, which indicates that IRP is a more robust modelling approach than ISM, as it incorporates the relationship of enablers with performance variables. Research limitations/implications: ISM and IRP modelling approaches are based solely on expert opinions and responses. This limitation can be overcome with the help of empirical study. Practical implications: This study supports the professionals/experts to prioritise and manage enablers at strategic and tactical levels while implementing lean manufacturing practices in Bulgarian SMEs. The models developed in the study will be helpful for practitioners to understand and analyse the interdependence of enablers for lean manufacturing implementation. Originality/value: This study helps to identify and prioritise enablers that affect lean manufacturing adoption using ISM and IRP approaches.

For technical organizations, sustainability implementation rests in a large part with the many engineering teams responsible for meeting client needs and organizational targets. Project and line managers have to influence those team members to adopt the moral characteristics necessary to engineer sustainable projects as part of everyday practice. To support their leadership efforts, we draw on care ethics and sustainability ethics in the form of an engineering ethic to propose a framework to orient and ground the reflective practices of those engineering managers. We discuss the challenges involved with internalizing this framework and suggest future empirical work needed before the framework can be operationalized.

El Hawi R.,57209361573;,Transformational leadership and rhetoric competencies for organizational success: Analysis of Jack's rhetoric,style_transformational,leadership_style,"The topic of leadership style has attracted considerable attention from both academics and practitioners. Contemporary theories about leadership argue that the psychological make-up of leaders can reflect their leadership style within their organizations. In other words, understanding leaders charisma would lead to an understanding of their influential actions. Charisma can be equated with transformational or inspiring behavior and both concepts play major roles in an organizations success. Transformational leaders are able to influence others through their behavior and their speech, using a high style of speech to produce a sense of attraction and admiration. Their language and rhetoric can play an essential role at the organizational level. In this article, we aim to focus on leaders speeches in contemporary dialogue, trying to determine their leadership style. We selected Jacks (an acknowledged charismatic leader) rhetoric as seen in one of his speeches, aiming to analyze and highlight the link between rhetoric and transformational behavior. Possible conclusions may be that leaders rhetoric can determine their leadership style, determining an organizations success. The research will conclude a number of key theoretical and practical implications that may emphasize the crucial role of leadership rhetoric for the prospects and development of an organization, which may be a key to success and innovation; it will help managers understand how to inspire employees through their speech for the benefit of the organization and society. © BEIESP.",2019,International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering,Organizations' performance; Rhetoric; Transformational Behavior,Organizations' performance; Rhetoric; Transformational Behavior

The explorative analysis of eight organizations from India and Australia demonstrates the prevalence of distributed leadership: operational and technical decisions are usually entrusted to the project team and project managers, while strategic decisions are made by senior management. The study suggests that three factors facilitate a specific leadership style (vertical or distributed): organizational culture, knowledge sharing and project management practices, which in turn impact the state of psychological contract (fulfillment/breach). A flexible, collaborative organizational culture supports knowledge sharing and the adoption of agile methods, enabling distributed leadership and leading to psychological contract fulfillment. © 2020",2021,International Journal of Project Management,Distributed leadership; Organizational culture; Psychological contract; Psychological contract breach; Psychological contract fulfilment; Vertical leadership,Distributed leadership; Organizational culture; Psychological contract; Psychological contract breach; Psychological contract fulfilment; Vertical leadership

For example, Schein defi nes culture as a pattern of shared fundamental assumptions learned by a group as it overcomes both external adaptation and internal integration obstacles, whereby group member use is effi cient enough to be considered valuable and which is taught to new members as the right way of meandering through the equivalent future obstacles. According to Dubkēvič and Barbars OC comprises structured behaviour (especially leadership style), language, rituals, ceremonies, myths, heroes, etc. The aim of this study is to examine the level of organizational culture in the Czech Republic and Poland, i.e. to make a comparison. In the questionnaire survey’s framework, 1,574 questionnaires were received in the Czech Republic, 1,476 questionnaires were processed, 433 questionnaires were received in Poland and 360 questionnaires were included in the evaluation for the same reason as the Czech questionnaires.

Findings: Results of the multiple regression analysis reflected direct and significant relationship between inclusive workplace and OCB. It has been observed that organizations with a conducive climate of inclusion, a well formulated inclusive practices and strong leaders’ commitment will result into high level of OCB which is apparent among employees working in a higher education institution western Uttar Pradesh. The results of z-test reflected that male and female employees have similar perception toward inclusive climate. However, there is a significant difference in perception toward inclusive practices and inclusive leadership on OCB. On the other hand, results of ANOVA reflected that with respect to religious orientation there is no significant difference among perceptions toward inclusive workplace. However in case of category employees have similar perception toward inclusive climate in contrast with inclusive practices and inclusive leadership. Research limitations/implications: The present study established the concept of inclusive workplace, entirely on the basis of individual viewpoint. While to examine the cause and effect relationship of an inclusive workplace on OCB, it is recommended to incorporate some moderating or intervening variables. Practical implications: This study provides guidelines for academic institutions to understand and foster an inclusive workplace that will encourage the academicians to exhibit OCB. Originality/value: Very little research had examined the relationship between inclusive workplace and OCB. This research will add value to the existing literature on inclusive workplace and its probable impact on organizations and individuals by examining this relationship with respect to gender, category and religious orientation of employees working in higher educational institution of India. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2018,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion",Higher education institution; Inclusive workplace; Organizational citizenship behaviour; Workforce diversity,Higher education institution; Inclusive workplace; Organizational citizenship behaviour; Workforce diversity

While research has confirmed the influence of leadership on the effectiveness of change, the author knows less about how increased environmental dynamism influences the relationship. This study aims to investigate how this relationship is impacted under highly uncertain and dynamic external conditions. Design/methodology/approach: To investigate the moderating effect of environmental dynamism on leadership practices and employees’ response to change, 1,536 employees’ survey responses were analysed from various organisations in South Africa. Moderator regression models were used to examine relationships. Findings: Environmental dynamism has a slight significant strengthening effect on the relationship between leadership practices and response to change, with regard to commitment to the change; efficacy, that is, the belief in whether the change will lead to the efficacy of the organisation; and valence or attractiveness of the change. However, no significant positive moderator effect on the impact of leadership practices on active support for change. Tenure as control variable also did not have a significant influence on the model. Practical implications: Organisations must take note that under dynamic conditions: employees’ belief about the efficacy of change is influenced by leadership practices, but not the active support for the change. Leadership must, thus, check whether employees’ positive responses are indeed going over in action to implement change. Originality/value: This study contributes an important moderator effect: the more dynamic the environment, the greater the impact leadership practices have on employee response to change. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2020,Management Research Review,Change management; Change response; Environmental dynamism; Leadership; Moderator effect; Organizational behaviour; Organizational development; Quantitative study,Change management; Change response; Environmental dynamism; Leadership; Moderator effect; Organizational behaviour; Organizational development; Quantitative study

Using a qualitative case study approach, the study interviewed four managers involved in related intrapreneurship initiatives. The data was validated by an expert and a practitioner from a different company. The implementation of the company's intrapreneurship strategy is limited to improving new ways of working and developing products and services. However, business development and the creation of new business models are still limited. From several intrapreneurship driving factors, it was observed that the company practices are considered adequate with regard to top management support, leadership, flexibility in carrying out work, as well as in fairly harmonious arrangements for ongoing business relationships with the intrapreneurship projects. On the other hand, human resources with entrepreneurial behavior are still minimal. Similarly, the driving factors in reward and training that promote entrepreneurial behavior are also considered to be insufficient. The application of intrapreneurship as a strategy requires understanding and commitment from all parties in the organization. This study provides insight into the Indonesian context and proposes that intrapreneurship initiatives are less likely to succeed if they are not supported by developing a more systematic entrepreneurial mindset, behavior, and culture. © 2020.

Design/methodology/approach: Survey questionnaires were administered on a 384-subject sample of the employees of the teams working in electronic businesses in Iran. The structural equation modeling and partial least square techniques were used to analyze the data. Findings: The results showed that transformational leadership has a positive impact on service quality and improves team performance. The effect of transformational leadership on the interpersonal trust and the trust on the team performance are also positive and significant. In summary, the improved performance also has a positive impact on service quality. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation is the assessment by questionnaire because the questionnaires measure the attitudes of individuals, not the facts as they are, and the attitudes of individuals usually involve personal judgments and prejudices in the research. Also, examining the research model in different cultural domains may provide different results because of being influenced by different cultures. Hence, the authors recommend that the findings should be examined in other communities with different cultures.

The transfer of learning from school to work requires that faculty provide guidance to support teamwork processes, including team communication. Literature review: Leader communication, especially when nondirective, has been associated with team success. Nondirective leaders influence others and develop quality relationships through personal rather than position power. Personal power is created partly through interactions in which a leader’s linguistic behavior effectively manages rapport with team members. Research questions: We wanted to explore the influence of team member feedback on leader rapport management, leader–member relationship quality, and perceived team effectiveness. Research methodology: We designed a feedback intervention that was delivered to team leaders within multidisciplinary student teams in a technical writing course. The study was a traditional, intervention-based, between-subjects quasi-experiment. Results/discussion: Despite its singular focus on team leader behavior, the intervention resulted in higher perceived group effectiveness. Although leader rapport management and leader–member relationship quality were higher in teams with feedback intervention, the effects were not statistically significant. Conclusion: We discuss several potential causes of our results, including several options for future research. Ultimately, because the intervention is simple to create and efficient to share, we conclude that it can supply instructors with one useful tool for intervening in student teamwork processes to improve team outcomes and for emphasizing the importance of interpersonal communication and leadership in teams. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication,Feedback; Interpersonal communication; Leadership; Rapport; Teams,Feedback; Interpersonal communication; Leadership; Rapport; Teams

As the organizational structures gradually improve flexibility, employees desire respect and development to a greater degree, which has given rise to a new leadership model-integrative leadership. This paper aims to investigate the impact of integrative leadership on employee’s innovation performance through a multilevel analysis. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes the two situational factors employee psychological empowerment and human resource flexibility as the mediating factors impact the relationship between integrative leadership and employee innovation performance. Valid questionnaires were collected from 619 employees from 135 leader groups of High-tech companies in China. Findings: The results show that integrative leadership has positive impact on employees’ innovation performance through its multilevel impacts on two mediation factors include psychological empowerment of employees and human resource flexibility. Research limitations/implications: This research used cross-sectional studies due to constraints of research conditions. The measurements of all variables are done simultaneously, whereas the effects of integrative leadership on the development of corporations should be presented in a dynamic process. Therefore, in the future research, vertical research design should be adopted to deeply explore the effectiveness mechanism of integrative leadership in the context of corporate internet-based transition. Practical implications: In the internet era, leaders cannot blindly pursue organizational performance. They must establish a flexible organizational structure and institutions to provide a platform for employee development, and integrative leaders need to pay attention to inspire the potential of employees and stimulate the enthusiasm of employees.

Howard Quartey S.,57190569485;,Examining employees’ safety behaviours: an industry-level investigation from Ghana,organizational,organizational,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine employees’ safety behaviours (ESBs) within the beverage manufacturing industry. It also assessed employees’ perception of their own safety behaviours. It further investigated the impact of organisational culture (OC) on ESBs. Finally, the study identified the likely determinants of ESBs. Design/methodology/approach: A survey methodology was employed as an appropriate approach. In total, 197 valid questionnaires were retrieved from employees working in the beverage manufacturing industry. The questionnaires were processed for quantitative analyses to test the hypotheses. A simple regression analysis was carried out to assess employees’ perception of their own safety behaviours and to investigate the impact of OC on ESBs. Descriptive frequencies and percentages were used to identify the determinants of ESBs. Findings: The results suggest that employees’ perception of their own safety behaviour was positive. OC was reported to have a strong positive impact on ESBs. Safe working conditions, job satisfaction and organisational leadership were identified as the key organisational determinants of safety behaviours among the employees. Research limitations/implications: Interpreting these findings must be done with caution as the sample size was relatively small and solely obtained from four beverage manufacturing firms. Generalising the findings from this study must also be carefully done as the study is industry-specific and country-specific. Practical implications: Besides the loss of talents through unsafe behaviours, accidents can hurt work performance, productivity and profitability of an organisation. Industry organisations and their managers can therefore implement perceptual, organisational and cultural interventions that reinforce appropriate safety behaviours among employees at the workplace. Social implications: Understanding these cultural, perceptual and organisational perspectives on ESBs is not only a significant input for safety behavioural analysis and interventions but can also reduce the socioeconomic cost of unsafe and risk behaviours among employees at the firm, industry, national and global levels. Originality/value: The empirical tests of employees’ perception of their own safety behaviours are heavily biased towards data originating from the developed country industry settings which suggest that the dynamics of ESBs in the less developed economies are likely to be unknown.

Design/methodology/approach: The exploratory sequential mixed methods design with two phases was used. Firstly, in the qualitative phase, the process of servant leadership in a military context was developed using a systematic approach of grounded theory. Secondly, in the quantitative phase, the relationship between the components of servant leadership was explained and the developed model was validated. Findings: The result of the qualitative phase show certain personal, organizational and social antecedents form the ideology of sacrifice in leaders which include: spiritually, intelligent and developed personality (personal antecedents); organizational culture, models and incentives (organizational antecedents); and reference groups and social events (social antecedents). The ideology of sacrifice resulted in choosing special behaviors of servant leadership by leaders. These behaviors include: creating service climate; developing standards; building trust; empowering followers comprehensively; and effective persuasion which cause positive personal and organizational outcomes. According to the results of quantitative phase, the proposed model has an appropriate fitness. Practical implications: The results of this research can be used to develop certain criteria for selecting servant leaders. Accordingly, certain training programs can be developed to promote competencies in organizational leaders.

Understanding structure agency in the delivery of respectful midwifery care in Uganda,organizational,organizational,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the findings of research on mothers and midwives' understanding of the concept of respectful care in the Ugandan public health settings. It focusses on one aspect of respect; namely communication that is perhaps least resource-dependent. The research found endemic levels of disrespect and tries to understand the reasons behind these organisational cultures and the role that governance could play in improving respect. Design/methodology/approach - The study involved a combination of in-depth qualitative interviews with mothers and midwives together with focus groups with a cohort of midwives registered for a degree. Findings - The findings highlight an alarming level of verbal abuse and poor communication that both deter women from attending public health facilities and, when they have to attend, reduces their willingness to disclose information about their health status. Respect is a major factor reducing the engagement of those women unable to afford private care, with health facilities in Uganda. Research limitations/implications - Access to quality care provided by skilled birth attendants (midwives) is known to be the major factor preventing improvements in maternal mortality and morbidity in low income settings. Although communication lies at the agency end of the structure-agency continuum, important aspects of governance contribute to high levels of disrespect. Originality/value - Whilst there is a lot of research on the concept of respectful care in high income settings applying this to the care environment in low resource settings is highly problematic. The findings presented here generate a more contextualised analysis generating important new insights which we hope will improve the quality of care in Uganda health facilities. © 2018 Emerald Publishing Limited.",2018,International Journal of Health Governance,Communication; Determinants of health; Governance structures; Leadership; Midwifery; Patient perspectives,Communication; Determinants of health; Governance structures; Leadership; Midwifery; Patient perspectives

This anticipatory approach's purpose is to evaluate the extent in which an organization is ready to implement a change initiative, in order to enhance supportive behaviors and identify improvement areas before engaging the change and thus reducing change adoption failure risks. A case study for the implementation of an Energy Management System according to the ISO 50001 Standard within a factory operating in the automotive sector is provided. Rather than the classical technical approach found in energy management maturity models, this approach offers an organizational perspective. The use of the Fuzzy Analytic Network Process allows the consideration of the interrelations between factors, while the use of fuzzy logic for the evaluation through linguistic variables helps in taking the uncertainty and imprecision of respondents into consideration. This approach serves as a decision support system for decision-makers by providing the organization's readiness maturity level as well as the identification of improvement areas that will help ensure a successful implementation of the desired change initiative. In the conducted case study, the obtained maturity level refers to an average readiness for change for the implementation of the Energy Management System and requires the definition of an improvement roadmap, comprising the following elements: ensuring top management leadership and organizational commitment and involving employees as well as internal communication on the personal and organizational benefits of the implementation of an Energy Management System. © 2022 Zineb Britel et al., published by Sciendo.",2022,Production Engineering Archives,Change readiness; Energy Management System; Fuzzy Analytic Network Process; ISO 50001; Maturity model,Change readiness; Energy Management System; Fuzzy Analytic Network Process; ISO 50001; Maturity model
"Nienaber H., Martins N.",15751492700;7005660283;,Exploratory study: Determine which dimensions enhance the levels of employee engagement to improve organisational effectiveness,organizational,organizational,"Purpose: Employee engagement recently emerged as a promising mechanism to improve organisational effectiveness and accordingly reduce the performance gap. This paper empirically demonstrates which employee engagement dimension(s) act as the strongest dimension to enhance the levels of employee engagement and consequently organisational effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative approach, specifically a survey design, using a questionnaire to collect data. Regression analysis was applied to predict the impact of the employee engagement dimensions on the level of employee engagement in organisations and the impact of online/social media, as part of communication, on employee engagement. Findings: The statistical analyses indicate that the dimensions organisational strategy and implementation, organisational commitment and team commitment are significant predictors of employee engagement. On-line/social media has a negative effect on employee engagement. However, according to the results, communication in organisations can be improved, especially by using online/social media more effectively. Research limitations/implications: This includes low response rate from some groups. Practical implications: The importance of secondary general management tasks, particularly motivation and communication, in mobilising employees to cooperate in pursuing organisational goals, became apparent. This study reflects the adverse effect of a lack of leadership and management skills, and ineffective use of online/social media on organisational performance, as reported in academic and practitioner research. Regardless, practitioners can apply the levers of motivation, via structural dimensions of organisation, to activate psychological presence which drives employee engagement and in turn facilitates strategy implementation and consequently organisational effectiveness. Scholars can modify their research agendas by investigating the “(un)availability” of human resources to improve organisational effectiveness. Social implications: The costs of disengaged employees are high, in terms of productivity losses and the performance gap, with adverse consequences for society. Originality/value: Employee engagement as a driver of strategy implementation is an overlooked area of research. This study offers a better explanation of employee engagement as a mechanism to improve strategy implementation, thus reducing the performance gap, and consequently waste. Employee engagement engenders employee support to pursue organisational goals, in a coordinated system of cooperation, and is produced by the structural dimensions of organisation, the parameters within which psychological presence is activated. Psychological presence drives employee engagement which enables employees to be available to implement strategy to achieve organisational goals and thus organisational effectiveness.

However, leaders may vary in their motivation to be effective in a leadership role, leading to different levels of performance. Drawing on self-determination theory, the authors address the question of what motivates leaders to engage in transformational leadership behaviors (Gilbert et al., 2016). The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The current study examined the effects of self-determined leader motivation for transformational leadership on aggregated follower leadership ratings using a sample of 37 leaders matched with 179 followers in two organizations. Findings: Results show how leaders’ own motivation relates to followers’ perceptions of leader behavior, and specifically that, across contexts, some autonomous levels of leader motivation are positively related to follower perceptions of leaders’ active-constructive leadership and negatively related to follower perceptions of passive avoidant leadership. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited by a small level-two sample size and cross-sectional design.

This paper draws from follower centric perspective and implicit leadership theories to explore factors that predict higher congruence between real and ideal leader in followers’ view. It also examines the impact of sociodemographic and organizational characteristics to the prediction of perceived congruence. 267 Lithuanian employees from private and public organizations participated in internet-based survey. Followers filled up a questionnaire about their direct middle supervisors: they rated fit between ideal and real leader, leader’s ethical behaviour and productivity of work unit. Results indicate that both ethical behaviour of a leader and productivity are important predictors of employees’ perceived congruence between real and ideal leader. However, ethical behaviour has significantly higher standardized beta coefficients in comparison with productivity in public sector organizations.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative study was conducted by interviewing fifteen high-level military officers (Brigadiers and Colonels). Data were analyzed according to the grounded theory method and a theoretical model was generated. Findings: A core variable was identified in the data analysis, the leader's use of organizational smooth power, using structural, emotional and relational smoothness, to gain organizational adaptability. The leader's professional background, experience and the organizational environment characteristics respectively interact as antecedent variables shaping the leader's contextual appraisal in order to implement smooth power. Further research suggestions are pointed out and practical and ethical implications are included. Research limitations/implications: The study was completed in a specific context, a higher-level military staff, which makes it context specific. We hypothesize that similar behaviors may be found in other organizations but further research should be conducted to test this. The sample size is relatively small due to the chosen qualitative research method. Practical implications: Practical considerations should be given to ethical and moral reflection within leadership training for ongoing use in leadership praxis, such as implementation and ongoing reflection of ethical leadership (Treviño et al., 2000; Treviño et al., 2003). Other practical impacts of this research may be for selection and retention efforts of high-level military staff workers. The model may also be useful for education purposes in order to increase awareness and abilities of smooth power concepts in an attempt to increase adaptability in military leadership. It may increase their awareness of skills rendered as necessary for collaborative efforts in multinational staff environments.

Murphy K.R.,7402863556;,"Performance evaluation will not die, but it should",others,others,"A wide range of systems for evaluating performance have been used in organisations, ranging from traditional annual performance appraisals to performance management systems built around informal, real-time evaluations, and these systems almost always fail. Rather than continuing to make cosmetic adjustments to this system, organisations should consider dropping the practice of regularly evaluating the performance of each of their employees, focusing rather on the small subset of situations in which evaluations of performance and performance feedback are actually useful. Four barriers to successful performance evaluation are reviewed: (a) the distribution of performance, (b) the continuing failure to devise reliable and valid methods for obtaining judgments about performance, (c) the limited utility of performance feedback to employees, and (d) the limited utility of performance evaluations to organisations. In this paper, I propose ways of managing performance without relying on regular performance evaluation, refocusing managers' activities from performance management to performance leadership. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2020,Human Resource Management Journal,HR function; human resource management; human resource strategy; performance management; performance related pay; supervisor,HR function; human resource management; human resource strategy; performance management; performance related pay; supervisor

Using the organizational change literature as background, this research analyzes the barriers and factors of success by comparing the perspectives of ERP implementers and end-users, identifying success factors and barriers of this project. A conceptual framework is developed. Design/methodology/approach: The case study method was used to conduct an in-depth analysis of the interviews that captured the complexity of this process. The change management project team had exactly 11 implementers, of whom ten were interviewed, and 45 end-users, of whom 20 were interviewed. Findings: The results suggest that end-users and implementers have opposite perceptions regarding the role of previous experience, organizational processes, capacity for change, leadership behavior, and the interaction of business units. In general, implementers presented a more critical perception of the change processes. Conversely, implementers and end-users agreed that business needs and cultural values facilitated the ERP implementation, whereas organizational structure and geographic dispersion constrain it. Research limitations/implications: This research could have analyzed the results by region or by production line. Originality/value: The major contribution of this research is to offer a conceptual framework to analyze different views about the same project. This study deepens the understanding of ERP implementations by adding studies from other countries and different cultures. For practitioners, this case study aims to offer the experiences and perceptions that implementers and end-users had about the largest ERP implementation system in Latin America. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",2017,Business Process Management Journal,Case studies; ERP; Organizational change; Project management,Case studies; ERP; Organizational change; Project management

Accordingly, there is a need to investigate how sustainable practices, such as green human resource management (HRM) practices, foster employee green behavior. Our study hence seeks to unfold whether responsible leadership and hospitality employees’ felt responsibility for the environment serve as a two-stage mediation mechanism for the link between green HRM practices and hospitality employees’ organizational citizenship behavior for the environment (OCBE). The data were collected from 392 employees and 84 supervisors from the Chinese hospitality context, and from 537 employees and 109 supervisors from the Vietnamese hospitality context. The findings revealed that, in both Chinese and Vietnamese samples, the effect of green HRM practices on hospitality employees’ OCBE was mediated by a two-stage mediation of responsible leadership and employees’ felt responsibility for the environment. HRM system strength served as a moderator to strengthen the association of green HRM practices with responsible leadership.

Kim J.,55862614200;,The Effects of Relative Organizational Tenure on Job Behaviors in the Public Sector,organizational,organizational,"From the perspective of organizational socialization, this study examines whether relative organizational tenure significantly influences desirable and undesirable behaviors in the public sector. We measured desirable behaviors in terms of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and public service motivation (PSM), and undesirable behaviors regarding turnover intention and burnout. In addition, we tested whether relative organizational tenure affected behaviors differently depending on employee status. Based on a survey of 203 public employees in local government in South Korea, this study conducted ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis to investigate the research model. We found that relative organizational tenure had significantly negative effects on both OCB and turnover intention but no significant effects on PSM and burnout. We also found that relative organizational tenure had a significant negative effect on the OCB of subordinates but not leaders. These results provide some implications for human resources management (HRM) with respect to relative organizational tenure in public organizations. © The Author(s) 2018.",2018,Public Personnel Management,job behavior; organizational socialization; relative organizational tenure; tenure,job behavior; organizational socialization; relative organizational tenure; tenure

In addition, the study also tries to highlight the role of gender as a moderator, whereby female (vs male) employees deferentially evaluate the importance of HQRs while engaging in OCBs. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted survey research by collecting data from 160 working adults and performed both basic mediation and mediated-moderated regression analysis with bootstrapping to determine the authors’ findings. Findings: Results of the study establish HQRs as important antecedents of employee citizenship behaviors, clarify the role of identity freedom as an important underlying psychological mechanism that mediates the relationship between HQRs and OCBs and position gender as an important boundary condition in the relationship between HQR and identity freedom, whereby female employees are more likely to enjoy identity freedom in the presence of HQRs, as opposed to males. Research limitations/implications: The present study illustrates the importance of HQRs and identity freedom as precursors of OCBs and in doing so expands the nomological net of OCBs, especially with respect to the antecedents of OCBs. The study also expands the scope of social identity theory by highlighting, in addition to social identity, the importance of identity expression. Practical implications: This study provides guidance to organizational practitioners to focus on building HQRs at work as HQRs, by making employees feel safe, pave the way for OCBs. In addition, the study also highlights the importance of gender as a moderator, whereby employees with different gender affiliations react differently to organizational contexts. Originality/value: Very little research has examined the relationship between HQRs and OCB. Antecedents of OCBs have been grouped into four categories: individual (or employee) characteristics, task characteristics, organizational characteristics and leadership behaviors. Clearly, the role played by the quality of interpersonal relationships in fostering OCBs has not been fully examined. By highlighting HQRs and identity freedom as antecedents of OCBs, the study informs the OCB literature by introducing interpersonal-relational and attitudinal elements as criterions of OCBs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2019,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion",Gender; High-quality relationships; Identity freedom; Organizational citizenship behaviours,Gender; High-quality relationships; Identity freedom; Organizational citizenship behaviours
"Baškarada S., Hanlon B.",8518601900;56480463500;,Corporate portfolio management in the public sector,others,others,"Purpose: Although corporate portfolio management (CPM) has been a popular tool for strategic management of multi-business portfolios in the private sector since the late 1960s, it has received limited attention in the public sector. Accordingly, empirical research on the use of CMP in government organizations is virtually non-existent. The purpose of this paper is to partially fill that gap in the literature by highlighting and discussing some of the key points that public sector organizations may need to consider when adopting CPM. Design/methodology/approach: Rather than deductively proposing and testing narrowly specified hypotheses, this study aims to answer a broad research question, namely: What are the key points that public sector organizations may need to consider when adopting CMP? Hence, the study adopts the qualitative interpretive research paradigm. The findings are based on empirical research conducted in a large Australian publicly funded research organization. Potential application of CPM was iteratively and incrementally explored with a reference group comprising 15 middle management representatives and several members of the senior leadership group over the course of one year. Findings: Assessment criteria traditionally used in CPM (e.g. growth potential and market share) are generally not applicable in public sector organizations. This paper suggests that government organizations should instead consider past performance and future potential of individual business units, which may be operationalized via capability (a function of human capital and associated resources/infrastructure) and delivery (a function of the demand for, and the impact of, relevant business units). The paper also highlights the importance of organization-wide consultation, evidence-based decision making, and contestability. Originality/value: From a practical perspective, the paper may assist public sector organizations with adapting and applying CPM. From a theoretical perspective, the paper highlights an important and relatively neglected research problem, and suggests several avenues for future research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2018,Journal of Management Development,Corporate portfolio management; Growth share matrix; Product-portfolio matrix; Public sector; Strategic management,Corporate portfolio management; Growth share matrix; Product-portfolio matrix; Public sector; Strategic management

Following the integration of emerging but disparate research on workplace positivity and related concepts, the paper develops a conceptual framework depicting the relationships amongst authentic leader behaviours, organisational virtuousness, psychological capital, thriving and job performance. Design/methodology/approach: The paper offers a systematic critical review of published studies representing the literature addressing authentic leadership, organisational virtuousness, thriving, psychological capital and job performance. The paper relied on computerised keyword searches in the main business source databases of Emerald, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, EBSCOhost and SpringerLink. Findings: This paper leads to a conceptual framework proposing direct relationships between authentic leadership, psychological capital, organisational virtuousness and job performance. Further, authentic leadership is proposed to potentially nurture organisational virtuousness, psychological capital, employee thriving and job performance, given the theoretical linkages between these conceptually relevant variables related to positivity. Additionally, organisational virtuousness and psychological capital are projected to mediate the relationship between authentic leadership and employee thriving. Finally, organisational virtuousness, psychological capital and employee thriving are designated as mediators of the relationship between authentic leadership and job performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper proposes a conceptual framework focusing on one form of positive leader behaviour and also assumes specific causal pathways using a positivistic research approach to understanding the leadership–performance relationship. The paper did not examine all possible antecedents of positivity at the workplace. Practical implications: The proposed conceptual framework should form the basis of many organisational interventions, especially in relation to boosting authentic leadership, organisational virtuousness, psychological capital, employee thriving and job performance. By suggesting the association between authentic leadership, psychological capital and organisational virtuousness, this paper highlights potential benefits from effective leaders’ commitment to enhancing psychological capital and organisational virtuousness and engendering thriving behaviour and job performance.

Case overview/synopsis: On November 8, 2019, Jack van der Merwe, the chief executive officer of the public rapid rail organisation, Gautrain Management Agency (GMA), was considering how to influence stakeholders to support the pace of the expansion planning phase, without alienating the surrounding communities and balancing the various and sometimes opposing stakeholder interests. The case highlights the background to this dilemma in offering the financial background of the Gauteng province and the evolution of the Gautrain project in the context of an emerging market country characterised by institutions at different development levels and how the unique characteristics of the protagonist could influence stakeholder orientations. The case illustrates how the Gautrain is at the centre of a complex transport conflagration in the South African transport ecosystem. Specific stakeholders and their needs are exposed in the case to enable students to analyse their several levels of influence on the project and proposed expansion. The differences between pro-poor and pro-growth development orientations are also highlighted in this case as input to describe the dilemma Van der Merwe faced in his influencing role in this particular South African context. Students will gain insight into how to manage the tensions between pro-poor and pro-growth orientations.

We hypothesise that perceptions of procedural and interactional justice can mediate said relationship. We collect data on 466 employees from three organisations located in three different economics sectors. Using structural equation modelling and a bootstrapping regression-based approach, our results reveal that the only factor that mediates the relationship between transformational leadership and work-family conflict is the perception of interactional justice. Thus, we conclude that organisational leaders should be more aware and take greater care with respect to their interactions with employees at work, as their behaviours “go beyond the organisational boundaries” and often affect their employees' family lives. Transformational leaders seem to allow employees to better manage the interface of their work and family lives given the perceptions of justice that their behaviours produce.

Data were analysed by means of item analysis and confirmatory factor analysis conducted via structural equation modelling (SEM). Results: High levels of reliability were found for the measurement scales. Good model fit was demonstrated for the measurement and structural models. Empirical support was found for the significant mediating effects of principled leadership and trust in leaders in the indirect relationship between moral intelligence and OCB. The Principled Leadership Scale (PLS) could be used in the selection or development of principled leaders to develop an ethical culture to combat the high levels of corruption that many organisations face. Principled leaders play a key role in creating an ethical and trusting work climate conducive for OCB. Conclusion: This study is the first to analyse the joint relationships among the specific latent variables in the structural model. Furthermore, the study provided the first supporting evidence for the concurrent validity of the newly developed PLS. © 2020. The Authors.

Sisson A.D.,57215070799;,Music festival supervisor leadership style and organizational citizenship behavior: the effects of employee and volunteer relationships and dependence on their leader,organizational,organizational,"Purpose: The relationship between leadership style and employee outcomes is well established. However, organizational management research lacks an understanding of the dyadic relationship between supervisors and employees and volunteers at music festivals. This study examines a mediation model in which leader–member exchange (LMX) affects leadership style and organizational citizenship behavior. Additionally, the study examines a moderating model in which dependence on the leader moderates relationships between leadership style and leader–member exchange. Design/methodology/approach: Confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling and conditional process analysis were employed to test the model using data collected from 97 supervisors, volunteers and employees who worked at an annual large-scale music festival staged in Costa Rica. Findings: Results reveal that leadership style relates positively to LMX and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Simultaneously, the mediating effect of LMX and moderating effect of dependence on the leader was not significant on the leadership style and OCB. Research limitations/implications: Given the small sample size and accessibility to one music festival, caution should be taken in drawing causal conclusions from the results. Practical implications: The study contributes to the knowledge of event and festival management with recommendations for leadership training initiatives for supervisors and employees/volunteers. Originality/value: This study is among the first to examine the mediating role of LMX between leadership style and OCB, moderating the role of dependence on leadership style and LMX with music festival supervisors and employees/volunteers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2021,International Journal of Event and Festival Management,Leader dependence; Leadership style; Leader–member exchange; Music festivals; Organizational citizenship behavior,Leader dependence; Leadership style; Leader–member exchange; Music festivals; Organizational citizenship behavior

In this study, how organizational climate, creative leadership ability and emotional reaction to imposed change impact on innovative behaviour of employees vis-à-vis knowledge sharing within the workplace is explored. Design/methodology/approach: Adopting a social cognitive perspective, a model is constructed to explain factors influencing the innovation behaviour of employees along two key aspects, that is, organizational climate (innovation vs risk-taking climate) and creative leadership ability (leadership skills, vision incentive) vis-à-vis other moderating factors. A survey questionnaire, administered to a total of 311 manufacturing employees in China, was used to verify the proposed research model via Smart PLS. Findings: Results unveil several key factors impacting positively on creative leadership in organizations. Specifically, creative leadership ability, emotional reaction to imposed change, innovation climate and knowledge sharing are found to impact positively on innovation behaviour while supportive versus risk-taking climate as well as emotional reaction are found to impact positively on innovation climate. Additionally, knowledge sharing is found to regulate the relationship between innovation climate and innovation behaviour. Research limitations/implications: While offering insights into the antecedent factors of innovation behaviour, the study extends research on the intermediary role of innovation climate and employees' innovation behaviour. Additionally, it improves one's understanding on the moderating role between knowledge sharing and innovation behaviour. Practical implications: The study findings will assist enterprises in diagnosing the implementation environment of innovation strategy, thereby providing a reference for training enterprise leadership while improving the employees' understanding of innovation and reform in the workplace.

Design/methodology/approach: The study is conducted in India and descriptive in nature. The structural equation modelling technique is used in the paper to test the relationships among the constructs directly and indirectly by mediation effect on how it raises the organizational deviance. Findings: The outcome of the study indicates that organizational deviance is highly influenced by narcissism, which also raises the toxic work culture and abusive supervision. The mentioned variables not only have a significant effect but also have a partial mediation effect on organizational deviance. The study significantly contributes to the literature with the findings that not only narcissism led to organizational deviance but additionally leads to high arousal through a positive relationship with toxic work culture and abusive supervision strongly leading to organizational deviance. Research limitations/implications: The study is for leaders who are more with self-love, demolishing peace and promoting the toxic work culture and deviant behaviours. Practical implications: Having narcissistic traits then turns into a complicated situation for employees to decide whether to stay in the organization or leave, and if these intentions are not developing, then it led to deviance on the part of employees. Social implications: A leader becomes so much obsessed with their egomania and uses the abusive supervision to dominate the team members. This pattern has to stop, as it fabricating the wrong connotation of the tranquillity of followers or team members.

Case overview: On April 16, 2016, the CEO of Prince Mshiyeni Memorial hospital, Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa, Dr Sandile Tshabalala reflected as he drove through the winding hills of the Cato range. In recent years, the hospital had been a subject of negative publicity with horror stories about patients collapsing while waiting for their medication at one of Durban’s largest hospitals. The case features a number of stakeholders and their demands and even threats. Contextual leadership intelligence requires accurate identification of relevant stakeholders and then involvement in solutions. The case illustrates how these demands had been listened to and how the stakeholders had been involved in finding solutions. A remarkable solution was to realize that the bottleneck at the pharmacy was actually caused by a problem early on in the process, for example, the late start of administrative staff who had to submit patients. A further solution was to utilize the primary health care clinics and even churches for dispensing chronic medicine. Expected learning outcomes: Gaining insight and foresight into the operations and supply chain dilemmas in public health care. Developing understanding of the impact of various stakeholders in the healthcare sector. Understanding buy-in when leading change.

However, research on ethical leadership has failed to examine the active role that followers' attributes play in enhancing or minimizing the influence of ethical leadership in organizational outcomes. We applied the substitutes for leadership approach (Kerr & Jermier, 1978) to ethical leadership and predicted that proactive personality acts as substitute in the relationship between ethical leadership, workplace emotions and organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs). Data from two distinct samples offered strong support for the hypotheses. Specifically, we found that ethical leadership was significantly and negatively related to negative workplace emotions when subordinate proactive personality was low, but not when it was high, with consequences for OCBs. These findings suggest that proactive personality constitutes an important moderator on the impact of low ethical leadership on workplace emotions, with consequences for OCBs. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2018,Leadership Quarterly,Ethical leadership; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Proactive personality; Substitutes for leadership; Workplace emotions,Ethical leadership; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Proactive personality; Substitutes for leadership; Workplace emotions

"Cheung C.M., Zhang R.P.",57189854261;57209802899;,How Organizational Support Can Cultivate a Multilevel Safety Climate in the Construction Industry,organizational,organizational,"Safety climate has a positive impact on safety performance in the construction industry; it is a multilevel phenomenon that can be formed at the organization and group levels, especially in large organizations with a multilevel management structure. This study investigates how organizational support cascades down to cultivate a group-level safety climate at two time points over a 2-year period through a relationship with an organization-level safety climate, supervisory safety-specific transformation leadership, and coworker support in a large US-based construction contractor. Structural equation modeling analysis on data from an online survey among 284 construction professionals shows, unlike prior research, that organizational support at one point in time does not directly predict a subsequent group-level safety climate. Instead, it affects the group-level safety climate through the mediation effect of supervisory safety-specific transformational leadership and organization-level safety climate and its moderating effect on the relationship between coworker support and group-level safety climate. Importantly, the results also suggest that safety-specific transformational leadership may be an even more important predictor of group-level safety climate than organization-level safety climate and coworker support. These results imply that organizational support could focus on empowering leaders to demonstrate safety-specific transformational leadership behaviors for the sake of promoting a group-level safety climate. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2020,Journal of Management in Engineering,Coworker support; Organizational support; Safety climate; Safety-specific transformational leadership; Structural equation modeling,Coworker support; Organizational support; Safety climate; Safety-specific transformational leadership; Structural equation modeling

Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative study that uses narrative inquiry and purposive sampling. Face-to-face and Skype interviews were conducted with 15 executives. Findings: Succession was unplanned in most of the Estonian nonprofits; successors were coached during initial transitionary periods; insiders were preferred to outsiders; requirements of executive positions were unmet because of a talent shortfall; lack of trust, unexpected behavior, and possible ethical issues were key risk factors associated with succession; and mixed opinions were received regarding the advantages and disadvantages of succession planning. Research limitations/implications: Narrow focus on Estonian nonprofit organizations and their executives, purposive sampling, and single qualitative research method. Results may not be applicable to other nonprofits. Practical implications: Practitioners of Estonian nonprofits can better understand the implications of executive succession issues. Lessons learned may help other nonprofit leaders. Social implications: Having a carefully crafted succession plan can enable smoother transitions between organizational leaders and create organizational stability, thereby ensuring a continuous delivery of goods and services to clients.

Exports,others,others,"Learning Outcomes: By reading and understanding this case study, students are expected to: 1.Able to understand and review the impact of unethical practices from accounting perspective; 2.Able to make an analysis of how one unethical act triggers a series of forced unethical acts (ripple effect); 3.Identify the unfair practices as well as be proactive in preventing unfair practices in the business day to day affairs; 4.Able to relate the function of various ratios (current ratio, quick ration, debt to asset ratio, debt to equity ratio etc.) and its impact on the business performance; and 5.Able to apply various lean quality tools, doing the root cause analysis in identifying and solving problems. Case Overview/Synopsis: T.M. Exports (TME) was an India-based privately owned and operated enterprise. The company had a brilliant employee named Sanjay, who was a 12-year veteran. TME’s Business Intelligence (BI) department at TME head office, Kanpur, India, ostensibly learned on April 8, 2019, from the rumors about a brand-new vehicle dished out to Sanjay by his friend who made fortune worth of millions from certain transactions. To add fuel to the fire, another incident surfaced concerning a warehouse keeper, Mohit, who was also involved in embezzlement in one of the sales offices. On May 16, 2019, BI reported these two incidents to the internal auditor who launched an internal investigation to get to root of this case. Consequently, the company owner, Tariq Mahmood got himself caught up in a dilemma to fire both Sanjay and Mohit only or restructure the organization for better transparency and integrative approach in future. Moreover, the newly appointed Chief Executive Officer had the dilemma of keeping high safety stock to maximize service level or keeping conservative safety stock and rely on-spot market-buying if demand spiked. He decided and instructed all the warehouses to keep higher inventories to meet the forecasted demand, considering unexpected spikes in demand witnessed historically. Thus, increase in inventory caused panic in the sales department as demand was sluggish. He, therefore, offered high discounted prices to liquidate the stock. This study integrated the theories of accounting/financial ratio metrics, accounts reconciliation, business ethics and lean tools. It was demonstrated in this case that the irregularities in sales accounting and their inability of reconciliation had a serious impact on business performance. The concept of total reward was also invoked to understand the disruptive and unscrupulous practices. Complexity Academic Level: This case has been particularly focused on undergraduate and postgraduate early-stage-level students pursuing business or commerce program, particularly those specializing in accounting (sales accounting) and human resource management courses.

Design/methodology/approach: The empirical study was based on data collected from 930 employees in China. The authors developed hypotheses to test the mediating effects of three types of perception in the relationship between an assertive influence strategy and five outcomes, and additional analyses on persuasive and relational influence strategies are also conducted. Findings: Results show that when subordinates attribute the cause to their ability (internal attribution), an assertive influence has indirect positive effect on felt obligation, organizational commitment, job performance and organizational citizenship behavior; when subordinates attribute the cause to the poor relationship with their superiors (relational attribution), an assertive influence has indirect negative impact on most outcomes except for job performance; when subordinates perceive that the cause is to the superiors, such as authoritarian leadership (external attribution), an assertive influence has indirect positive effect on job performance.

This study explains the process through which i-deals lead to positive employee outcomes in the form of increased employee job satisfaction, organizational citizenship behavior, job performance, and reduced employee turnover. We hypothesized that employees’ perceived organizational support (POS), quality of relationship with the supervisor known as leader–member exchange (LMX), and quality of the relationship with the supervisor in comparison to others in the group termed as leader–member exchange social comparison (LMXSC) mediates the relationships between i-deals to outcomes. In a sample of 338 faculty employees nested in 49 departments from a private university, we found support for direct relationships between i-deals, outcomes, and mediators (POS, LMX, and LMXSC).

Zueva-Owens A.,42263093600;,"Fools, jesters and the possibility of responsible leadership",style_ethical,leadership_style,The vibrant academic and practitioner conversation about corporate responsibility does not appear to reduce the number of scandals involving unethical managerial behaviour. This leaves the question of whether responsible organisational leadership is possible. Some leadership scholars recently suggested that understanding leadership as a relational process can facilitate more responsible leadership practice. This article develops the relational leadership perspective by offering a critical discussion of the possibility of responsible relational leadership. I construct an understanding of responsibility following the writings of Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida. I then use the archetypal figure of the Fool as an imaginary device to translate Levinasian and Derridian ethics into lived experiences and thus illuminate the conditions under which responsibility may be possibilised. This theoretical analysis exposes the irresolvable tension between responsibility and the relational in leadership but also identifies ways through which leadership actors can strive for responsibility through purposefully engaging with the tension. © The Author(s) 2019.,2020,Organization,Aporia; archetypes; Derrida; Levinas; responsible leadership; the fool,Aporia; archetypes; Derrida; Levinas; responsible leadership; the fool

Drawing on a sample of 372 followers from 97 teams in China, it was found that the negative effect of differentiated empowering leadership on followers’ trust in leaders became salient when followers’ Chinese traditionality was low. Moreover, followers’ trust in leaders mediated the effect of differentiated empowering leadership and Chinese traditionality on followers’ in-role performance, extra-role performance, and counterproductive work behaviors toward the organization. These findings have implications for managerial theory and practice in the domains of trust and differentiated empowering leadership. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",2017,Journal of Business Ethics,Chinese traditionality; Counterproductive work behaviors; Differentiated empowering leadership; Extra-role performance; In-role performance; Trust in leaders,Chinese traditionality; Counterproductive work behaviors; Differentiated empowering leadership; Extra-role performance; In-role performance; Trust in leaders
